# Issue guidelines

1. Check that icon you're about to request doesn't [already exist](full_preview.md) or requested in the [issues](https://github.com/krisu5/aegis-icons/issues).
2. Read the issue template and fill at least required parts.
3. If you have question or miscellaneous suggestion, check [FAQ](FAQ.md) first.
4. Please don't request icons that possibly are overly complex to make ([example](https://github.com/krisu5/aegis-icons/issues/92)). Ask yourself if the icon is really worth of time and effort.
   - Aegis-icons can reject any icon request for any reason. But most of the requests gets filled. Usually we do provide explanation and possibly alternative option if we reject the request.
5. For forums we have decided to make icons based of forum software they use, because those are more universally usable for icons then specific communities. **This is judged case by case.**
   - Finding out the forum software, we are using tools such as [What CMS](https://whatcms.org).
6. Be kind and nice. Remember, we are humans too.
