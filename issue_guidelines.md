# Issue guidelines

1. Check that icon you're about to request doesn't [already exist](full_preview.md) or requested in the [issues](https://github.com/krisu5/aegis-icons/issues).
2. Read the issue template and fill at least required parts.
3. If you have question or miscellaneous suggestion, check [FAQ](FAQ.md) first.
4. Don't ask icons that are overly complex to make ([example](https://github.com/krisu5/aegis-icons/issues/92)). Ask yourself if the icon is really worth of time and effort.
   - Aegis-icons can reject any icon request for any reason. But usually we do provide explanation and possibly alternative option.
5. Be kind and nice. Remember, we are humans too.
