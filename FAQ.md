# Frequently Asked Questions

## How I use these icons?

1. Either download icons [separately](/PNG) or as [icon pack ZIP](../../releases/latest) (click to unhide "Assets" sections and download ZIP that starts with word "PNGs")
   - If you downloaded icon pack, use file manager to unzip it (if you don't have one, I recommend [Amaze](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amaze.filemanager&hl=en_US))
    - If you didn't find a icon for site / app you wanted, [double-check here](full_preview.md) and [make a issue](https://github.com/krisu5/aegis-icons/issues) you didn't find one.
2. In Aegis, long press 2FA account you want to add the icon and click "pencil" icon to edit. [ðŸ–¼ Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3540275/80872785-e875dc80-8cbc-11ea-8451-0fff3ed4565f.png)
3. In "Edit Profile", press the circle that has one letter in it. [ðŸ–¼ Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3540275/80872798-f9bee900-8cbc-11ea-9a7d-c0f94a675044.png)
4. Select app for finding icons (like file manager or gallery app).
5. Go to folder where the icons are and select icon image you want.
6. After selecting the icon, there's *checkmark button* you **have to press** for confirming selected icon. [ðŸ–¼ Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3540275/80872803-00e5f700-8cbd-11ea-911d-a573d95d4299.png)
7. Click "Save". [ðŸ–¼ Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3540275/80872809-08a59b80-8cbd-11ea-88cf-39c932fc4710.png)

Repeat steps 2 to 7 for other accounts.

## These icons aren't integrated in the app?

Currently these icons aren't integrated in the app or way to automate the process.

"Aegis icons" is still unofficial project that doesn't relate to original app in any way.

## Can't you make an app for automating the process?

Sorry, I'm just designer. I don't have any programming background and personally don't enjoy programming that much.

If you want to do it, be my guest! Or even better, [fork the Aegis app itself](https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis).
