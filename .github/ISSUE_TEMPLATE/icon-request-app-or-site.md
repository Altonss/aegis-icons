- URL of the site or app **(required):**

<!-- ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ --
NO PROFILE PICTURES (Twitter, Facebook, Github etc.) OF ANY KIND AS LOGO RESOURCE, these are not helpful at all.

If you're adding IMAGE as logo resource, it has to be either:

1. SVG vector from official source (or other vector file format, vectors are most preferable)
 OR
2. High quality (at least 1000 x 1000 pixels) image from official source (image size does not include white space around the logo, has to have smooth edges, no artifacts etc).

Also, it has be currently used logo by the company.

If your finding doesn't fit any of the criterias, it's best to leave it empty. -->
