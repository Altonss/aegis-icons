🚫 NO PROFILE PICTURES (Twitter, Facebook, Github etc.) of any kind or SMALL IMAGES as logo resources, these are not helpful.

If you're adding IMAGE as logo resource, it has to be either:

1. SVG vector from official source (vectors are most preferable)
   OR
2. High quality (at least 1000 x 1000 pixels) image from official source (image size does not include white space around the logo, has to have smooth edges, no artifacts etc).

⚠️ Logo image(s) must be currently used by the company.

👎🏼 If your findings doesn't fit to any of the criterias, it's best to leave it just empty.
