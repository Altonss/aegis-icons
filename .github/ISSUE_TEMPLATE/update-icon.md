<!-- ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
NO PROFILE PICTURES (Twitter, Facebook, Github etc.) OF ANY KIND AS LOGO RESOURCE, these are not helpful at all.

If you're adding IMAGE as logo resource, it has to be either:

1. SVG vector from official source (or other vector file format, vectors are most preferable)
 OR
2. High quality image from official source (at least 1000px on either sides [does not include white space around the logo], smooth edges, no artifacts etc).

Also, it has be currently used logo by the company.

If your finding doesn't fit any of the criterias, it's best to leave it empty. -->
