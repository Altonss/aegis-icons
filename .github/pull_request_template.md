**URL of the site:**

<!-- ▲▲▲ REQUIRED, UNLESS it's generic icon. -->

**Logo / icon info:**

<!-- ▲▲▲ REQUIRED!

For example:
- Direct URL of the logo file / press kit page / logo resource page.
- Short info of how did you get the logo.
  - For site embedded vectors, eg. ➜
      ❝  Extracted logo with SVG Gobbler from https://example.com/exact-page  ❞
  - For image tracing, eg. ➜
      ❝  Image traced of https://example.com/logo.jpg with Vectorizer.io  ❞
- If it's generic icon ➜
    ❝  [Icon name] from Unicons / Feather / Lucide / Cryptocurrency Icons  ❞

❌ IT CANNOT BE COPY-PASTE OF THE "URL of the site or app" PART. -->

**Background color info:**

<!-- ▲▲▲ REQUIRED, UNLESS it's generic icon.

Fill this part based of this information:
- Is the color taken somewhere from the logo?
   - If YES, add this text ➜
      ❝  Background color is from the logo.  ❞
- Is color taken from the mentioned app / site? (And not from logo)
   - If YES, do either/all of these things:
      - Upload screenshot of the area where you got the color AND give URL of the page (unless it's from app)
         - How to upload screenshot: https://is.gd/github_attach_files
      - Give the HTML element name (eg. #footer) AND also URL of the page.
